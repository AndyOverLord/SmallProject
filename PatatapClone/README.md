I did this project to practice how to cooperate with JavaScript library such as: <br>
Paper.js, howler.js

paper.js
-------

Paper.js is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, all neatly wrapped up in a well designed, consistent and clean programming interface.

howler.js
----------

It's an audio library for the modern web.
howler.js makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.
